## Purpose

This is a CentOS 7 image with the latest stable Ruby interpreter, and a
system install of rbenv for managing Ruby and the gems needed to provide
a portable Cucumber testing environment. It generates CentOS 7
containers for Cucumber testing.

More generally, it can be (ab)used to provide a Docker-based VM (of
sorts) for running your Cucumber tests locally, or share your QA
platforms during pairing on Docker-enabled platforms like [CodeEnvy][5].
You replace a full-featured VM or CI server with this Docker image at
your own risk.
